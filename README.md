## Learn Python Fundamentals
- Basics of Python syntax, data types, variables, and operators.
- Control flow statements: if-else, loops (for, while), and exception handling.
- Functions, modules, and packages.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Working with built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- File I/O operations.

## Understand HTTP and Web Basics
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.).
- Basics of RESTful APIs.
- Client-server architecture.
- Understanding of web servers and web frameworks.

## Learn Flask or Django
### Flask
- Lightweight and flexible micro-framework.
- Routing, templates, and request handling.
- Integrating with databases (SQLAlchemy, SQLite, etc.).
- Securing web applications.
- RESTful API development with Flask-RESTful or Flask-RestPlus.

### Django
- Full-stack web framework with batteries included.
- MVC architecture: Models, Views, Templates.
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.
- Forms and validation.
- Django REST Framework for API development.

## Database Management
- SQL basics (queries, CRUD operations).
- Database design principles (Normalization, Indexing, etc.).
- Working with relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
- NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Redis.
- Integration with Flask/Django ORM.

## Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, etc.).
- Session management.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Implementing authentication in Flask/Django applications.

## RESTful API Development
- Designing RESTful APIs adhering to best practices.
- Versioning APIs.
- Serialization and deserialization.
- Handling authentication and authorization.
- Documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

## Testing
- Unit testing with frameworks like unittest or pytest.
- Integration testing.
- Mocking external dependencies.
- Test-driven development (TDD) practices.

## Deployment and DevOps
- Containerization with Docker.
- Orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure).
- Server management and monitoring.

## Advanced Topics
- Asynchronous programming with asyncio or libraries like Celery.
- WebSockets for real-time communication.
- Microservices architecture.
- GraphQL for API development.
- Security best practices (HTTPS, OWASP Top 10, etc.).
